# Olivier-Messiaen-Modes

I created this repo to share my [Olivier-Messiaen-Modes.reascale](Olivier-Messiaen-Modes.reascale)
 to enable the Olivier Messiaen's Modes of limited transposition in [REAPER](https://www.reaper.fm/) DAW.

## REAPER Scale Implementation of Olivier Messiaen's Modes of Limited Transposition

The Olivier-Messiaen-Modes.reascale file is a specialized scale definition file for REAPER, a digital audio workstation (DAW). This file encodes Olivier Messiaen's seven Modes of Limited Transposition, providing a practical tool for musicians and composers working with these unique harmonic structures in a digital environment.
Key features of this file include:

- Comprehensive Coverage: All seven of Messiaen's modes are represented, from the simplest (Mode 1, the whole-tone scale) to the most complex (Mode 7).
- Detailed Labeling: Each mode is clearly labeled with its number and interval structure (e.g., "Mode 1 2-2-2-2-2-2").
- Numeric Encoding: The modes are encoded using REAPER's numeric system, where each digit represents a semitone step in the scale.
- Metadata: The file includes version information and authorship details, indicating ongoing development and refinement.
- Educational Comments: Each mode is preceded by comments detailing its structural characteristics, including the number of notes, transpositions, and shifts, as well as a brief description.
- Base Implementation: This version (0.2) provides the basic form of each mode without shifts or transpositions, serving as a foundation for further development.

This .reascale file serves as both a practical tool for implementing Messiaen's modes in REAPER-based compositions and as an educational resource for understanding the structure of these influential 20th-century harmonic innovations. It bridges music theory and digital music production, making Messiaen's complex modal system more accessible to modern composers and producers.
